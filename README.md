# Prerequisite-course-management-system
The C++ program models course registration using a binary tree. It reads course info from a text file, builds a tree with prerequisites, takes user input on completed and desired courses, and provides results on feasible courses based on their history.

## Features

- Construct a course prerequisite tree from input data.
- Input the courses you have already studied and the courses you are interested in studying.
- Determine which courses you can take based on your past courses and their prerequisites.
- Display the results of eligible and ineligible courses.

## Usage

1. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler. 
2. Run the compiled executable
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your past courses and desired future courses.
4. The program will display the courses you can study and the ones you cannot study. 

## Input Data Format

The program reads course data from the `registration.txt` file. Each line in the file should be in the format:
101Introduction to Programming,None
207Fundamental of Data Structures & Algorithms,101
311Computer Architecture,
